A fun Biography 
====================================
Written by Tyler Caldron

The purpose of this code is to allow a user to input biographical information such as name, height, weight, etc...
and display it back to them along with some fun console messages for comedic effect. 
The user is supposed to be able to edit the previous entries and view the entire list for convenience. 

The software is separated into various classes for efficiency and to provide it with a good framework to work with and allow easy modification.
